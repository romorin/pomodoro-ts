# Pomodoro2

My Free Code Camp [pomodoro](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock) page. Can also be seen on the [web](http://romorin.com/pomodoro-ts).

This is a version based on the Angular2 project reusing the common core logic code and using vanilla methods to interact with the html.
